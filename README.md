# Coffee-Business-Sales-Analysis
# Executive Summary
The Coffee Sales Spreadsheet comprises multiple datasets related to various aspects of a coffee sales business operations. Using formulas and functions, a main dataset was conformed to offer a comprehensive view of sales behavior on demanded products based on different coffee types and categories. Pivot tables and charts, slicers, and a timeline component were used to create a dashboard to track sales over time, better market segmentation, and customer classification. 
After identifying that the greater number of orders are placed from the United States and customers under the loyalty program generated  46.35% of the total business revenue, I suggested to the marketing staff recommendations that will lead to maximizing earnings under the loyalty program:
1.	To conduct a feedback program on the target audience. 
2.	A marketing campaign on the benefits of the loyalty program. 
3.	To use social media and online advertising that leads to attracting a wider customer base.

# Business Problem
The Coffee Sales Business loyalty program was designed as a strategy to attract and retain loyal customers for the Coffee Sales Business. While encouraging repeat business, customers earn points based on their purchases and interactions, such as referrals and product reviews. The points are stored in a digital card and can be redeemed for discounts, rewards, and special offers. Despite this, Sales Stakeholders have noticed a sales drop under the loyalty program. How can we increase sales generated under the loyalty program?

# Methodology
1.	Data pre-processing with the use of formulas and spreadsheet functionalities that guarantee the integrity and consistency of the data
2.	Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), focusing on summary statistics to understand data context and gain insights within the datasets. 
3.	Build a dashboard that tracks sales over time for every coffee type
4.	Communicate the results and determine the best areas of opportunity 

# Results and Business Recommendations
Creating a dashboard to track coffee product sales gives stakeholders a perspective of the business performance, based on the key sales metric: Total sales by coffee types, units sold, and top-selling products. Sales behavior was shown as a line chart, displaying trends over time. A timeline visual component was included to compare periods better and expose how sales are performing compared to previous periods. This characteristic includes month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons.
A regional performance can be analyzed in the dashboard through a bar chart that shows how sales are distributed by country, guiding sales stakeholders to identify the areas of strength and new opportunities. This chart type was also used to show market segmentation, based on the top 5 customers that provide the highest revenues to the business delimited by country. Stakeholders can benefit from this, having a better understanding of their customer base.

The analysis derived that:
1.	More than 53% of the total business sales are generated by customers who are not enrolled in the business loyalty program. 
2.	Of the entire registered orders, 2.73% represent orders placed by customers who bought on more than one occasion, and 1.42% of them, were loyalty program-associated customers.
3.	Excelsa coffee type is the product that reached 29% of whole sales under the loyalty program, and Liberica the 28% out of the program (Fig 2-Fig 3)
4.	Under the loyalty program, the products experiencing increasing demand are 2.5 kg packages of Dark Robusta coffee type and 0.2 kg packages of Light Robusta.
5.	Sales generated outside the loyalty program by-products with a tendency to grow are 0.5 kg packages of Light Arabica and 2.5 kg packages of Dark Liberica

Because the biggest revenue impacts will likely come from enhancing the loyalty program and the marketing efforts, I recommend the following adjustments:
1.	To conduct a systematic feedback program on the target audience to better understand product preferences, market trends, and areas to improve.
2.	To develop a promotional campaign that stands out the benefits of the loyalty program such as promotions, rewards, and discounts to attract new clients and retain existing ones.
3.	To incorporate and promote best and new offers under loyalty program, for the coffee products that are consistently popular and contribute significantly to the business's revenue outside the program.
4.	To use social media and online advertising that leads to attracting a wider customer base.

# Next Steps
While it's essential to maintain the core products that drive sales, it is also beneficial to incorporate and promote products with growth potential to meet evolving consumer preferences and stay competitive in the market. By balancing the offerings and strategically introducing new benefits while maintaining the sales of existing popular items, this coffee business can position itself for long-term success.
